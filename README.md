# ðŸ§  Blue Prism: Automated Data Entry Bot

This repository contains the full documentation and process design for an **Automated Data Entry Bot** built using **Blue Prism v7.4.0**. The bot reads customer data from an Excel file and simulates entering it into a digital form. It was created as a portfolio-ready automation for job applications in banking and financial institutions.
